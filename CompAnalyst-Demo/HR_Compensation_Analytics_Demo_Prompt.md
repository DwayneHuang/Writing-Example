# HR Compensation Analytics Platform Demo

## Project Goal

Build a high-fidelity web application demo for an HR Compensation Analytics Platform.

This is a demonstration product for interviews and client presentations.

The objective is to showcase how HR teams can:

- Price a Job
- Benchmark compensation against market data
- Analyze employee compensation
- Manage relocation adjustments
- Perform compensation planning and budgeting

The application should feel like a modern SaaS HR analytics product rather than a simple dashboard.
